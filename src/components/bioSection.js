            <p>I am a German-Guatemalan developer, who is passionate about programming and doing it through clean code. Besides developing stuff, I love spending time with my wife, travelling and anything that is tech related. I enjoy to drink coffee and rum (not necessarily together), especially if they are Guatemalan. I have a soft spot for anything related to super heroes, Legos or T-rexes. <br/>#geek<span aria-label="Smiley with Glasses" role="img">ðŸ¤“</span></p>
